Spoilagram

www.spoilagram.com

A spoiler website that allows users to upload image files and add a pre-created watermark then share with friends on various social media sites.

Designed by Brian Frost and Antonio Marcato for a fun pithc idea and to add to their creative photo.

Development and design by Justin Sarnik.

For me this was my first attempt at php, versus my usual ASP.NET and (c# backend).
